 * Say you have an array for which the i^th element is the price of a given
 * stock on day i.
 * 
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many
 * transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock
 * multiple times) with the following restrictions:
 * 
 * 
 * You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must

 * After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1
 * day)
 *

 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
 * Output: 3 
 * Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
